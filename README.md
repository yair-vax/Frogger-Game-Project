# Frogger-Game-Project
This is a version of the classic game Frogger. Programed in System Verilog and used on an FPGA Board.

📌 Project Overview

This project is a full hardware implementation of the classic Frogger game, developed entirely in SystemVerilog and deployed on an FPGA board as part of the Lab 1A course at the Technion.
All game logic, graphics, and timing are implemented at the hardware level, showcasing digital design principles, FSM control, and real-time VGA signal generation.

The project demonstrates low-level hardware design, real-time processing, and FPGA-based system integration.

🛠️ Features
